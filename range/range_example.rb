a method {#succ} because it is possible to find out the successor of an instance
of this class.

  # Returns the successor of this element. If you comment out this method, the Range#include?
  # method will fail. This is because since a {Range} of instances of this class is <i>not</i>
  # a range of Numeric instances, Ruby 1.9 calls this method on first element of the range,
  # compares the returned value with given value. If this method is commented out, when you call
  # {Range#include?}, you will get "in `each': can't iterate from Discrete (TypeError)"
  # @return [Discrete] an instance of {Discrete} that is this instance's successor
  # @see #<=>

  # Overrides Object#<=>, the well known spaceship operator.
  # @note
  # This method is a <i>must</i> for caller to be able to create {Range} instances
  # out of instances of this class. If you comment out this method, you get
  # <b> bad value for range (ArgumentError) </b> error when you try to create
  # an instance of this {Range} with instances of this class.

  # @param [Discrete] other instance of this class to compare with
  # @return [Integer] -1 if this comes before other, 0 if this is same as other and 1 if this
  # comes after other, in this class's natural order
  # @see #succ

  # Ruby's <i> equality</i> operator. This is essential for the methods like
  # {Range#include?} to work. If you comment out this method,
  # you will get incorrect answer for the include? method. Interestingly, but
  # not surprisingly, {Range#cover?} continues to work as expected even if you
  # comment out this method because that method only depends on the spaceship
  # operator.
  # @param [Discrete] other instance of this class to compare with
  # @return true if this is <i> same </i> as other, false otherwise
